# About
This is my personal website / interactive resume / portfolio.
It is written in React.js which requires a good amount of html, css, and JavaScript.
In addition to React I also utilized Semantic UI as a css library.

# Components
Other than Semantic UI everything else was coded by me. I'm particularly proud of the carousel feature. It has some
semantic UI elements, like the buttons, but the component as a whole was developed by me. It can be reused and it
can be horizontal or vertical, the time lapse can be adjusted, and the number of images/objects showing at one time can also be adjusted from 1 to up to 3.
In addition to all of that it is designed so any react component can be used as the objects in the carousel, so it will display any component given to it.
It could be photos, but also videos, or cards, etc.
