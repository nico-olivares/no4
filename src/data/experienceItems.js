                From April to October of 2020, I attended a Fullstack bootcamp by UNF - Fullstack Academy. 
                There I learned the JavaScript full stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, PostgreSQL, React, node, git, github, and more. 
                The camp was project driven. Each week (sometimes longer periods) we would code a project. 
                The last two projects were group efforts and involved git control and teamwork. 
                For the final group project, my peers asked me to be project leader. Our Capstone project was the largest project of the camp. 
                After the camp was over, I have continued to code and learn in order to keep my skills sharp and improve as much as possible.
