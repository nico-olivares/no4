        reference: `Nicolas was an absolute pleasure to have as a student! I was his instructor at the UNF Fullstack coding bootcamp where he impressed me day after day. He posed intelligent questions during lectures that would drive our class conversations forward and demonstrate his deep and natural understanding of programming. The projects he submitted for class were always top-notch quality. I think Nicolas was born to program as the practice seems to be a natural extension for him. Beyond that he is a kind, patient, and professional person with the perfect temperament to work on any team. Nicolas would make a great addition to any organization looking to hire a talented software engineer.`

Since the beginning of the cohort, Nicolas quickly demonstrated a high understanding of Javascript concepts and dedicated countless hours out of class to assemble beautiful applications throughout the course. What impressed me the most was many a times, Nicolas’ submitted class projects that were above and beyond requirements. I advise anyone interested in Nicolas to take the time to inquire about them. Nicolas is an exceptional team player making huge contributions, a very charismatic person and any team would be so lucky to have him on board.`

        reference: `Nick is always willing to help others, especially when it comes to uncharted territories.
        This was especially evident when we made the transition to virtual in the spring. He was continuously 
        researching TEAMS in order to provide assistance to the faculty in order to help make for a smooth transition. 
        He's always been so supportive of our faculty and always goes the "extra" mile to help us. In addition, he always 
        does an amazing job on our yearbook, which is a lot of work. 
        I feel Nick is well deserving of this recognition!`

        reference: `When we went to Duval Homeroom at the drop of a hat last year, Nicholas was there 
        to help in multiple ways. He never complains when he is asked countless tech questions from all of us. 
        He made multiple tutorial videos which gave all of us some guidance. Nicholas is dedicated and a team player. 
        He works diligently from behind the scenes to help the whole Crown Point Team. With the multiple hats he wears 
        as a science instructor, technology support to staff, leadership events leader, and translator to families, 
        Nicholas is an essential part of CPE. He creates a love of science in our students and offers support in many ways 
        to his fellow colleagues. This is why I would like to nominate, Nicholas Olivares for Teacher of the Year.
