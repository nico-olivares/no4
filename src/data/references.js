        reference: `Nick is always willing to help others, especially when it comes to uncharted territories.
        This was especially evident when we made the transition to virtual in the spring. He was continuously 
        researching TEAMS in order to provide assistance to the faculty in order to help make for a smooth transition. 
        He's always been so supportive of our faculty and always goes the "extra" mile to help us. In addition, he always 
        does an amazing job on our yearbook, which is a lot of work. 
        I feel Nick is well deserving of this recognition!`

        reference: `When we went to Duval Homeroom at the drop of a hat last year, Nicholas was there 
        to help in multiple ways. He never complains when he is asked countless tech questions from all of us. 
        He made multiple tutorial videos which gave all of us some guidance. Nicholas is dedicated and a team player. 
        He works diligently from behind the scenes to help the whole Crown Point Team. With the multiple hats he wears 
        as a science instructor, technology support to staff, leadership events leader, and translator to families, 
        Nicholas is an essential part of CPE. He creates a love of science in our students and offers support in many ways 
        to his fellow colleagues. This is why I would like to nominate, Nicholas Olivares for Teacher of the Year.
